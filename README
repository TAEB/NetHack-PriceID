NetHack-PriceID 0.03

NetHack, the game of princes, has a large item-identification subgame. The
quickest way to gauge how useful an item is is to "price identify" it. This
involves trying to buy or sell the item in a store, which tells you its price.
Item types (scrolls, potions, wands, etc) are each divided into about five
price groups -- price IDing cuts down a large number of possible identities of
an item.

The calculations for price IDing aren't that difficult, but making sure to get
all the edge cases (such as trying to identify items while the shopkeeper is
attacking you -- and charging you more money) can be twiddly.

This module also comes with a priceid script.
